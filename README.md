### Problem 1

Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

### Problem 2
Contains Duplicate

Given an array of integers and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and the difference between i and j is at most k AKA `( j - i <= k )`.

### Problem 3

Pascal's Triangle

Given numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

For example, given `numRows = 5`, return
```
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

### Problem 4

Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

### Problem 5

Sum of Strings
Given the string representations of two integers, return the string representation of the sum of those integers.

For example:

`sumStrings('1','2') // => '3'`

A string representation of an integer will contain no characters besides the ten numerals `'0'` to `'9'`.

### Problem 6

Add Binary
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

For example, `a = "11" b = "1"`
Return `"100"`.
